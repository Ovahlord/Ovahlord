## Hey there, I'm Ovahlord

I'm a hobby C++ developer who has been into WoW private server development for well over a decade by now. I've learned C++ from scratch only to become able to work on the emulator software myself. I'm among the last few folks out there who do open source work and as of the time of writing this, I'm the only maintainer of the last Cataclysm expansion fork of TrinityCore that is somewhat up to date. Feel free to check it out here: [https://github.com/The-Cataclysm-Preservation-Project/TrinityCore]
However, over the years I've also started to develop an interest in GameDev so I've picked up various game engines, such as Unity, Unreal and Godot, yet only Unity truly stuck with me due to it's unmatched accessibility when it comes to figuring things out. Because of that decision, I've been confronted with learning C# as well and by this time, this is my 2nd (proper) programming language that I've learned to use. While I'm diving into the depths of game development, I'm also maintaining a small repository with handy Unity components and APIs that I've written myself to build myself a small library of assets that can be used in multiple projects.
